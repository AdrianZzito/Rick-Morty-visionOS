# Rick-Morty-visionOS

In this app, we take advantage of the Rick and Morty API to create this test application for the Apple Vision Pro. 
With this app, i intent to keep practising with the visionOS SDK and keep getting familiar with the basic interfaces and windows before i move on to use
RealityKit, ARKit, etc... In this app you have three different tabs to get on, the first of all is "Characters", 
here you will see all the characters of the Rick and Morty's series, when you select one of them, you will see it's details as well as a list with all the episodes where that character appears on.
Next you have a tab called "Locations", those are all the locations that are visited on the serie, whe you select any of them, you will see more details of that location 
and a list displaying all the residents of that location.
Finally you have another tab called "Episodes", here you can check for the information of all the Rick and Morty's episodes and in the details of them you will have a 
list with all the characters that appear on that particular episode. Here you have some photos of the application:
